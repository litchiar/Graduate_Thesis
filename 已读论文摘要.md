### 1 Human Action Recognition without Human

The objective of this paper is to evaluate “human action
recognition without human”. Motion representation is fre-
quently discussed in human action recognition. We have
examined several sophisticated options, such as dense tra-
jectories (DT) and the two-stream convolutional neural net-
work (CNN). However, some features from the background
could be too strong, as shown in some recent studies on hu-
man action recognition. Therefore, we considered whether
a background sequence alone can classify human actions in
current large-scale action datasets (e.g., UCF101).
In this paper, we propose a novel concept for human ac-
tion analysis that is named “human action recognition with-
out human”. An experiment clearly shows the effect of a
background sequence for understanding an action label.

### 2 Action Quality Assessment Across Multiple Actions

Can learning to measure the quality of an action help in
measuring the quality of other actions? If so, can consoli-
dated samples from multiple actions help improve the per-
formance of current approaches? In this paper , we carry
out experiments to see if knowledge transfer is possible in
the action quality assessment (AQA) setting. Experiments
are carried out on our newly released AQA dataset (http:
//rtis.oit.unlv.edu/datasets.html) consist-
ing of 1106 action samples from seven actions with qual-
ity as measured by expert human judges. Our experimental
results show that there is utility in learning a single model
across multiple actions.

### 3  Cross-dataset action detection

In recent years, many research works have been car-
ried out to recognize human actions from video clips. T o
learn an effective action classifier, most of the previous ap-
proaches rely on enough training labels. When being re-
quired to recognize the action in a different dataset, these
approaches have to re-train the model using new labels.
However, labeling video sequences is a very tedious and
time-consuming task, especially when detailed spatial lo-
cations and time durations are required. In this paper, we
propose an adaptive action detection approach which re-
duces the requirement of training labels and is able to han-
dle the task of cross-dataset action detection with few or no
extra training labels. Our approach combines model adap-
tation and action detection into a Maximum a Posterior
(MAP) estimation framework, which explores the spatial-
temporal coherence of actions and makes good use of the
prior information which can be obtained without supervi-
sion. Our approach obtains state-of-the-art results on KTH
actiondatasetusingonly50%of the training labels in tradi-
tion approaches. Furthermore, we show that our approach
is effective for the cross-dataset detection which adapts the
model trained on KTH to two other challenging datasets1.

### 4 Targeted Dropout

Neural networks are extremely flexible models due to their large number of pa-
rameters, which is beneficial for learning, but also highly redundant. This makes
it possible to compress neural networks without having a drastic effect on perfor-
mance. We introduce targeted dropout, a strategy for post hoc pruning of neural
network weights and units that builds the pruning mechanism directly into learning.
At each weight update, targeted dropout selects a candidate set for pruning using a
simple selection criterion, and then stochastically prunes the network via dropout
applied to this set. The resulting network learns to be explicitly robust to pruning,
comparing favourably to more complicated regularization schemes while at the
same time being extremely simple to implement, and easy to tune.
